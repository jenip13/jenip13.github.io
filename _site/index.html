<p>Hey, I’m Jenisha. I was born, raised and educated in Montreal, Canada 🇨🇦. I’m an incoming Software Engineer at Cisco, on the verge of graduating from McGill University.</p>

<p>I have previously done Data Science on very large things at the Canadian Space Agency 🔭 and research on very small things at Computational Bioengineering and Genomics labs 🔬.</p>

<p>I am passionate about using technology for social good and increasing diversity in STEM. During my undergrad, I have helped lead the fabrication of a <a href="https://github.com/NTX-McGill/NeuroTechX-McGill-2019">brain-controlled wheelchair</a> for severely disabled patients and lead the expansion of McGill Women in Computer Science <a href="https://www.facebook.com/McWiCS/">(McWiCS)</a> at its co-president.</p>

<p>When I’m not working, I like to explore new places, go to concerts, come up with cringy memes and taste the sundubu jjigae (soft tofu soup) of various Korean restaurants.</p>
